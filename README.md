# log4j2-fish-tagging
springboot mvc + slf4j and log4j2 + request trace configuration

Demonstrates how we can use log4j2 filters to change logging level and redirect logs to the different (tracking log) file.
You can track a request using a tag specified in the request.  

# How to
To enable fishing you need to set the following HTTP headers:

* fishing-level - obligatory, fishing logging level ['debug','trace']
* fishing-tag - optional, custom tag which will be set in logging ThreadContext and used in logging pattern


```bash
curl --header "fishing-level: debug" localhost:8080/fishing
```
fishing on debug level with autogenerated tag
'
```bash
curl --header "fishing-level: trace" --header "fishing-tag: my-fishing-tag" localhost:8080/fishing
```
fishing on trace level with custom tag


Fishing logs will be forwarded to *log4jfishing.trace.log* for custom setting please reffer to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/manual/configuration.html and project log4j2.xml file.
